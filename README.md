Create function called computerPlay that will randomly return 'Rock' 'Paper' or 'Scissors'

Write a function that plays a single round of PSR. The function should take two parameters - playerSelection & computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".

Make your functions playerSelection parameter case-insensitive.

IMPORTANT NOTE: you want to return the results of this function, not console.log() them.

Write a new function called game(). Use the previous function inside this one to play a 5 round game tha tkeeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

You have not officially learned how to "loop" over code yet... Just call playRound function 5 times in a row.

At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.

Use prompt to get input from the user:

Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.

Feel free to create more "helper" functions if you think it would be more useful.
