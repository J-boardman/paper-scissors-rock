OG algorithm:

1. Ask computer to return a value of rock, paper or scissors, chosen at random.

2. Ask for input from user. User can choose from rock, paper or scissors. Choice should be case insensitive.

3. Play a round of paper, scissors, rock, using the user and computer inputs to determine the result of the round. Return result.

4. Since *loop* hasnt been taught yet, call the round function 5 times.

5. Determine the winner based on 5 rounds of the game.
